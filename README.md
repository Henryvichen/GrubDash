This is a project made during Thinkful's software engineering course

There was heavy focus on backend development here, the scenario was :

You've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash! 
As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that the frontend developers can demo some initial design ideas for the big bosses.

There were various learning goals for this project, specifically :

Running tests from the command line

Using common middleware packages

Receiving requests through routes

Accessing relevant information through route parameters

Building an API following RESTful design principles

Writing custom middleware functions

It was a great chance to put everything that I learned about the backend together into one project!
